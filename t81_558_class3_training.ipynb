    "\n",
    "Neural networks require their input to be a fixed number of columns.  This is very similar to spreadsheet data.  This input must be completely numeric.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to represent the data in a way that the neural network can train from it.  In class 6, we will see even more ways to preprocess data.  For now, we will look at several of the most basic ways to transform data for a neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we look at specific ways to preprocess data, it is important to consider four basic types of data, as defined by [Stanley Smith Stevens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Smith_Stevens).  These are commonly referred to as the [levels of measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Character Data (strings)\n",
    "    * **Nominal** - Individual discrete items, no order. For example: color, zip code, shape.\n",
    "    * **Ordinal** - Individual discrete items that can be ordered.  For example: grade level, job title, Starbucks(tm) coffee size (tall, vente, grande) \n",
    "* Numeric Data\n",
    "    * **Interval** - Numeric values, no defined start.  For example, temperature.  You would never say \"yesterday was twice as hot as today\".\n",
    "    * **Ratio** - Numeric values, clearly defined start.  For example, speed.  You would say that \"The first car is going twice as fast as the second.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code contains several useful functions to encode the feature vector for various types of data.  Encoding data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **encode_text_dummy** - Encode text fields, such as the iris species as a single field for each class.  Three classes would become \"0,0,1\" \"0,1,0\" and \"1,0,0\". Encode non-target predictors this way. Good for nominal.\n",
    "* **encode_text_index** - Encode text fields, such as the iris species as a single numeric field as \"0\" \"1\" and \"2\".  Encode the target field for a classification this way.  Good for nominal.\n",
    "* **encode_numeric_zscore** - Encode numeric values as a z-score.  Neural networks deal well with \"centered\" fields, zscore is usually a good starting point for interval/ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Ordinal values can be encoded as dummy or index.  Later we will see a more advanced means of encoding*\n",
    "\n",
    "Dealing with missing data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **missing_median** - Fill all missing values with the median value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating the final feature vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **to_xy** - Once all fields are numeric, this function can provide the x and y matrixes that are used to fit the neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other utility functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **hms_string** - Print out an elapsed time string.\n",
    "* **chart_regression** - Display a chart to show how well a regression performs.\n"
